## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph-$(hotname)/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph-$(hotname)/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as local markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical roles used as-is: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: root `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
